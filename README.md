# CSS322-Scientific-Computing
 
**CSS322 Scientific Computing** is a course taught by Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT), Thailand, in 1/2024 (the first semester of the 2024 academic year) for second-year students in *Computer Engineering* and *Digital Engineering*. However, the author of this repository studied **Electrical Engineering**; therefore, if there are any mistakes in the contents or programming, please feel free to contact me.

The courses covered:
1. [System of linear equations](2-Systems-of-Linear-Equations)
2. [Norms](3-Norms)
3. [Approximations in scientific computing](4-Approximations-in-Scientific-Computing-and-Computer-Arithmetic)
4. [Conditioning and stability](5-Conditioning-and-Stability)
5. [More on solving linear systems](6-Extra-Systems-of-Linear-Equations)
6. [Interpolation](7-Interpolation)
7. [Numerical integration](8-Numerical-Integration) (a.k.a quadrature)
8. [Numerical differentiation](9-Numerical-Differentiation)
9. [Linear least square](10-Linear-Least-Square)
10. [Nonlinear equations](11-Nonlinear-Equations)
11. [Optimization](12-Optimization)
11. [Initial value problems for ordinary differential equations](13-IVP) (IVP for ODE)
12. [Singular value decomposition](14-SVD) (SVD)
13. [Eigenvalues and eigenvectors](15-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors)

This course maninly utilizes [MATLAB](https://julialang.org/) to demenstrate scientific computing tasks; however, the author uses [Julia](https://julialang.org/) due to its superior performance in scientific computing.
Julia is preferable for laptop users because of its faster execution compared to MATLAB.


If you are new to Julia, please refer to the first chapter, [Introduction to Julia](1-Introduction-to-Julia), which is based on the in [Introduction to Julia (for programmers)](https://juliaacademy.com/p/intro-to-julia) course offered by [JuliaAcademy](https://juliaacademy.com/).
