# Gaussian-Jordan Elimination (GJE)

#=
    The reason why GJE is not aplied to solve linear equation 
    because of the inaccurate solution from floating-point arithmetic 
    and the 50% more operation counts requirement.

    Howver, GJE is mathematically elegant is useful in proving many theorems.
    GJE is also useful in parallel computing.
