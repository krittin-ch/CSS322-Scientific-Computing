Optimization Problem

Optimization in One Dimension
    The problem: Given f, find x that minimizes f(x)
    Such x is called a minimizer and often denoted x*

    This will cover only local optimization as global optimization is mmuch more difficult to obtain.
    (Informal) Definition: x* is a local minimizer of f when f(x*) is smaller than or equal to the function values of all points near x*.
