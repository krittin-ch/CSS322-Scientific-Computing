A is a matrix with dimensions of n × n. If Ax = λx, λ is a scalar, x ≠ 0, 
we say that λ is an eigenvalue of A and x is an eigenvector of x.

Note: If x is an eigenvector, so is αx for any nonzero scalar α.
    If Ax = λx, then A(αx) = α(Ax) = α(λx) = λ(αx).

Eigenvalues/eigenvectors are used in physics, analysis of vibration and stability, 
analysis of ordinary differential equtions and their algorithms, etc.

Theorem
    Suppose A is symmetric. Then all eigenvalues of A are real.
